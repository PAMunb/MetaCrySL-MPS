# MetaCrySL

MPS-based MetaCrySL language. The original MetaCrySL implementation was developed in Rascal. This one aims to implement the refinements feature from MetaCrySL but using a XText approach.

The CrySL language is used by the [CogniCrypt](https://www.eclipse.org/cognicrypt/) plugin to automatically identify misuse of cryptographic APIs. MetaCrySL further enhances this language by providing the tools that allow developers to write meta-specifications in **"*.mcsl"** files. Those meta-specifications can be refined to actual CrySL rules by use of the refinements language.
